<div>Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea.

"True rats" are members of the genus Rattus, the most important of which to humans are the black rat, Rattus 

rattus, and the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus. Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred 

to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats.

Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a large muroid rodent, 

its common name includes the term rat, while if it is smaller, the name includes the term mouse. The muroid family 

is broad and complex, and the common terms rat and mouse are not taxonomically specific. Scientifically, the terms 

are not confined to members of the Rattus and Mus genera, for example, the pack rat and cotton mouse.

The best-known rat species are the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). The group is 

generally known as the Old World rats or true rats, and originated in Asia. Rats are bigger than most Old World 

mice, which are their relatives, but seldom weigh over 500 grams (1.1 lb) in the wild.

The term "rat" is also used in the names of other small mammals which are not true rats. Examples include the 

North American pack rats, a number of species loosely called kangaroo rats, and others. Rats such as the bandicoot 

rat (Bandicota bengalensis) are murine rodents related to true rats, but are not members of the genus Rattus. Male 

rats are called bucks, unmated females are called does, pregnant or parent females are called dams, and infants 

are called kittens or pups. A group of rats is referred to as a mischief.
