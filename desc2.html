<div>The characteristic tail of Murids also displays a unique defense mechanism known as "degloving" in which the outer layer of the integument can be detached in order to facilitate the animal's escape from a predator. Interestingly, however, this evolutionary selective pressure has persisted despite a multitude of pathologies that can manifest upon shedding part of the tail and exposing more interior elements to the environment.[12] Paramount among these are bacterial and viral infection, as the high density of vascular tissue within the tail becomes exposed upon avulsion or similar injury to the structure. The degloving response is a nocifensive response, meaning that it occurs when the animal is subjected to acute pain, such as when a predator snatches the organism by the tail.The most widespread species of rats are Rattus norvegicus, the Norway or brown rat; Rattus rattus, the black, ship, roof, or alexandrian rat; R. exulans, the Polynesian rat; and Bandicota bengalensis, the lesser bandicoot rat. Both R. norvegicus and R. rattus are found around the world, and these are the two commensal species found in North American cities. They are longtime residents
